# Ohio University IEEE Micromouse 2019
## Python
The python code is to be used with [mms](https://github.com/mackorone/mms). We are using the python API provided with mms to simulate the mouse before we have the mouse built and are able to start testing the code on the actual hardware.
## C++
The C++ code will be used on the teensy microcontroller that will power the mouse. It will be compiled with the Arduino IDE.
